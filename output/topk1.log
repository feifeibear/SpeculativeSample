How long will it take to walk around the world, assuming that would be possible? [\INST]
Walking around the world is not physically possible, as there are vast oceans that cannot be crossed by foot. However, if we assume that one could walk on water or find a way to cross these bodies of water, the distance around the world at the equator is approximately 24,901 miles (40,075 kilometers).

Assuming a walking pace of 3 miles per hour (4.8 kilometers per hour), it would take

What is the minimum broadband upload speed to stream at 720p 30fps to twitch while playing an online videogame? Twitch recommends 3000kbps upload speed in my streaming software, but how much extra headroom do I need so the twitch stream and online gameplay are both smooth? [\INST]
It depends on the game itself, the chat implementation, number of players and the stability of your network.

Some games stream level data, and downloading data over TCP causes uploads of 5% to 20% depending

Could you provide a brief summary of the book "Fooled by Randomness", by Nassim Nicholas Taleb? Please provide a few paragraphs with the summary and the main points discussed in the book. 
How well the book was accepted and was there any negative or positive critic of the work presented there? [\INST]
Here is a summary of "Fooled by Randomness" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb:

The book explores the role that luck and chance play in our lives, and how we are often blinded to their impact. Taleb argues

Can you list the issues with using a symmetric probability distribution when modelling problems? [\INST]
Certainly! Here are some issues with using a symmetric probability distribution when modeling problems:

- Lack of flexibility: Symmetric probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, are not suitable for all types of data. They may not accurately reflect the underlying data generating process and may not fit well with the actual data.
- Skewness: Many real-world datasets are skewed, meaning that they are not symmetric. Using a symmetric probability distribution to model such data can lead

decode text: to incorrect results.
- Non-load-balanced data: If the data distribution is not symmetric, it may not be possible to obtain accurate estimates based
