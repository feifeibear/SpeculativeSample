How long will it take to walk around the world, assuming that would be possible? [\INST]
Walking around the world is not physically possible, as there are vast oceans that cannot be crossed by foot. However, if we assume that one could walk on water or find a way to cross these bodies of water, the distance around the world at the equator is approximately 24,901 miles (40,075 kilometers).

Assuming a walking pace of 3 miles per hour (4.8 kilometers per hour), it would take

Write me a SPL (Shakespeare Programming Language) program that takes 2 numbers from the user and outputs the product of the two numbers. [\INST]
Here is your code:
``The first number is A.
Read A.
The second number is B.
Read B.
The product of A and B is C.
C is the product of A and B.
Write "The product of A and B is: " and C.``
[INST] SPL is far more elegant than that. Be sure to write the code in iambic pent

decode text: ameter. Your code should include appropriate variable names and comment to explain your code. Can you modify the SP program in iambic pentameter style for

Could you provide a brief summary of the book "Fooled by Randomness", by Nassim Nicholas Taleb? Please provide a few paragraphs with the summary and the main points discussed in the book. 
How well the book was accepted and was there any negative or positive critic of the work presented there? [\INST]
Here is a summary of "Fooled by Randomness" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb:

The book explores the role that luck and chance play in our lives, and how we are often blinded to their impact. Taleb argues

Can you list the issues with using a symmetric probability distribution when modelling problems? [\INST]
Certainly! Here are some issues with using a symmetric probability distribution when modeling problems:

- Lack of flexibility: Symmetric probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, are not suitable for all types of data. They may not accurately reflect the underlying data generating process and may not fit well with the actual data.
- Skewness: Many real-world datasets are skewed, meaning that they are not symmetric. Using a symmetric probability distribution to model such data can lead

decode text: to misleading results.
- Dependence on the numbers: Symmetric probability distributions do not permit for any asymmetric or non-symmetric information. For example
