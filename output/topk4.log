How long will it take to walk around the world, assuming that would be possible? [\INST]
Walking around the world is not physically possible, as there are vast oceans that cannot be crossed by foot. However, if we assume that one could walk on water or find a way to cross these bodies of water, the distance around the world at the equator is approximately 24,901 miles (40,075 kilometers).

Assuming a walking pace of 3 miles per hour (4.8 kilometers per hour), it would take

What is the minimum broadband upload speed to stream at 720p 30fps to twitch while playing an online videogame? Twitch recommends 3000kbps upload speed in my streaming software, but how much extra headroom do I need so the twitch stream and online gameplay are both smooth? [\INST]

What is the best way to form a new habit? [\INST]
Forming a new habit can be challenging, but with persistence and some effective strategies, it is possible to establish new, healthy habits. Here are some tips that can help:

Start small: Focus on forming a new habit one step at a time. For example, if your goal is to exercise every day, start with just 10 minutes a day and gradually increase the amount of time you exercise.

Be consistent: The key to forming a new habit is consistency. Try to perform

Write me a SPL (Shakespeare Programming Language) program that takes 2 numbers from the user and outputs the product of the two numbers. [\INST]
Here is your code:
``The first number is A.
Read A.
The second number is B.
Read B.
The product of A and B is C.
C is the product of A and B.
Write "The product of A and B is: " and C.``
[INST] SPL is far more elegant than that. Be sure to write the code in iambic pent

Can you list the issues with using a symmetric probability distribution when modelling problems? [\INST]
Certainly! Here are some issues with using a symmetric probability distribution when modeling problems:

- Lack of flexibility: Symmetric probability distributions, such as the normal distribution, are not suitable for all types of data. They may not accurately reflect the underlying data generating process and may not fit well with the actual data.
- Skewness: Many real-world datasets are skewed, meaning that they are not symmetric. Using a symmetric probability distribution to model such data can lead

- Inconsistency: Asymmetric distributions can be much more complex to handle than symmetric ones. They
